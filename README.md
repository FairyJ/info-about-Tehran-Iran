# Comp 484 Project 1
* https://farzanehjahanip1.glitch.me
* Due TBD (Check on Canvas)
* Purpose : In this project you are going to create the HTML and CSS for a website to match a
consistent look and feel.
* * Requirements : To complete this project you will write and submit 5 files: 4 HTML documents
and 1 CSS document. The CSS file should contain the main style and formatting of the project.
You may use glitch or any editor that you prefer. For this project no use of libraries or automated
CSS code-generation will be allowed. I want you to come up with the structure of your site and
write the HTML and CSS that you feel fits that style. You may use lecture slides and the past
hw’s for sample code but make sure to make it your own.
* The purpose of this lab is to create a personal site about one of your interests. Examples
include but are not limited to: favorite movie, show, book, artist, band, genre, sport, team,
person, place to visit, etc. Be as creative as you wish. If you have other ideas for your site we
can further discuss online.
* Review lecture material and make proper use of the elements, properties, and roles covered.
What I will be grading on:
* Submission instructions followed (4 html and 1 css file submitted, with no contents
except plain-text HTML and CSS respectively)
* HTML and CSS has proper formatting and comments where appropriate
* Web page renders properly in Chrome
* Web page contains all required content, visually organized and styled according to spec
* CSS rules and HTML tags abide by specifications given in lectures
* Look up the MDN reference site for 3 elements and 3 attributes not covered in class .
Use them on your website. Add comments describing what they are and how you are
using them.
* Cheating : This project will be an individual project. You can discuss this project with other
students. You can explain what needs to be done and give suggestions on how to do it. You
cannot share source code. If two projects are submitted which show significant similarity in
source code then both students will receive an F for the project. Note a person who gives his
code to another student also fails the project (you are facilitating the dishonest actions of
another).
