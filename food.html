          5 BEST PERSIAN FOODS THAT YOU’VE GOT TO TRY
        </h2>
        <h3>Khoresht-e fesenjan</h3>

                This iconic stew, an essential part of every Persian wedding
                menu. Khoresht-e fesenjan traditionally made with duck, this
                dish also works well with chicken or lamb. In the north of Iran
                it is sometimes made with fish. It is a relatively easy khoresht
                to make, but it must be cooked slowly to allow the flavours to
                develop in the sauce. The consistency should be thick and creamy
                and the colour almost black. The distinctive flavour combines
                the nutty taste of ground walnuts with the sweet and sour
                flavour of pomegranate syrup.

        <h3>Chelo kabab koobideh</h3>

                Kebabs have more variety than you might think. First, there’s
                Koobideh, ground meat seasoned with minced onion, salt and
                pepper. It sounds simple, but the taste is sublime. There is
                kebab-e Barg, thinly sliced lamb or beef, flavored with lemon
                juice and onion and basted with saffron and butter. Chicken
                kebab, known as Joojeh, is traditionally made from a whole
                chicken, bones and all, for more flavor (although in American
                restaurants it’s often made from skinless chicken breast),
                marinated in lemon and onion, and basted with saffron and
                butter. If you’re lucky, you’ll find jigar, lamb liver kebab,
                garnished with fresh basil leaves and a wedge of lemon.

        <h3>Zereshk polo</h3>
        <div class="row_food">

              <p class="text_box">
                The sweet and sour flavour of zereshk (barberries) and the
                glistening ruby red berries set against the white and saffron
                tinged grains make this a feast for the taste buds and the eyes.
                Zereshk polo is served at weddings and other celebrations
                because it is impressive and easy to make in large quantities.
                It is usually served with chicken, but it is also delicious with
                Saffron yogurt lamb.

        <h3>Khoresht-e gheimeh</h3>

                Before the introduction of electric fridges, families in the
                colder, northern provinces of Iran such as Azerbaijan devised
                ingenious ways to preserve meat for consumption during the
                winter months. The meat would be cut into small pieces
                (gheimeh), fried with onions, flavoured with turmeric and other
                spices and put into big earthenware vats. A thick layer of
                solidified fat on the top ensures a good seal against
                micro-organisms. These vats were kept in dark, cold basements
                over the winter. Each day, a small amount would be taken to add
                to the khoresht. Khoresht-e gheimeh is diced meat combined with
                yellow split peas, dried limes and saffron with fried potatoes.
                It is very popular all over Iran and can be cooked all year
                round; the combination of meat and pulses, served with rice,
                provides a nutritious meal.

        <h3>Tahchin</h3>

                Tahchin is an Iranian rice cake that includes rice, yogurt,
                saffron, egg, and chicken fillets. It is also possible to use
                vegetables, fish, or meat instead of the chicken fillets.
                Tahchin is composed of two different parts: The thin Tahdig part
                which includes the chicken fillets, saffron, and other
                ingredients at the bottom of the cooking pot and the second part
                which is the white rice. In restaurants, Tahchin is mostly
                prepared and served without the white rice part.
