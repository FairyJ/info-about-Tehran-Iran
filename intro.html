              >What we saw, what we came back with, is a deeply confusing story.
              Because the Iran you see from the inside, once you walk the
              streets of Tehran, once you meet Iranians, is a very different
              place than the Iran you know from the news. Nowhere else I’ve been
              has the disconnect been so extreme between what one sees and feels
              from the people and what one sees and hears from the
              government.</q

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <section>
          <p class="blocktext">
            Tehran, is the capital of Iran and Tehran Province. Tehran is the
            centre of most Iranian industries including automotive, electrical,
            military, weaponry, textiles, sugar, cement, and chemical. Tehran is
            also a leading centre for the sale of carpets and furniture. In the
            20th century, Tehran was subject to mass-migration of people from
            all around Iran. Tehran has a diverse range of peopl, cultures and
            religions, notably a sizable Armenian community. Many languages are
            spoken within its boundaries as a result. The city is home to many

              >Zoroastrian fire temples</a

            structures, of which

              the Milad Tower and the Azadi (freedom) Tower
            </a>
            have come to be symbols of Tehran itself. Internationally Tehran is
            the least expensive capital in the world and only the second least
            expensive city globally based on Cost-of-living index, in addition
            to presenting the best value for money in the world. If you spend
            time in tehran you'll soon realise that the city is so much more
            than a chaotic jumble of concrete and crazy traffic blanketed by a
            miasma of air pollution. This is the nation's dynamic beating heart
            and the place to get a handle on modern Iran and what its future
            will likely be.
