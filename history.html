          <p class="blocktext">
            Tehran is situated within the historical region of Media (Old
            Persian: êé∂êé†êé≠ MƒÅda) in northwestern Iran. By the time of the Median
            Empire, a part of the territory of present-day Tehran was a suburb
            of the prominent Median city of Rhages (Old Persian: êéºêé•êé† RagƒÅ). In
            the Avesta's Videvdat, Rhages is mentioned as the 12th sacred place
            created by Ohrmazd. In Old Persian inscriptions, Rhages appears as a
            province (Bistun 2, 10‚Äì18). From Rhages, Darius I sent
            reinforcements to his father Hystaspes, who was putting down the
            rebellion in Parthia (Bistun 3, 1‚Äì10). In some Middle Persian texts,
            Rhages is given as the birthplace of Zoroaster,although modern
            historians generally place the birth of Zoroaster in Khorasan.
            Rhages's modern-day inheritor, Ray, is a city located towards the
            southern end of Tehran, which has been absorbed into the
            metropolitan area of Greater Tehran. Mount Damavand, the highest
            peak of Iran, which is located near Tehran, is an important location
            in Ferdowsi's ≈†ƒÅhnƒÅme,the Iranian epic poem that is based on the
            ancient legends of Iran. It appears in the epics as the homeland of
            the protoplast Keyumars, the birthplace of king Manuchehr, the place
            where king Freydun binds the dragon fiend A≈ædahƒÅk (Bivarasp), and
            the place where Arash shot his arrow from.

            Medieval period
          </h3>
          <p class="blocktext">
            During the reign of the Sassanian Empire, in 641, Yazdgerd III
            issued his last appeal to the nation from Rhages, before fleeing to
            Khorasan.Rhages was dominated by the Parthian Mehran family, and
            Siyavakhsh‚Äîthe son of Mehran the son of Bahram Chobin‚Äîwho resisted
            the 7th-century Muslim invasion of Iran.Because of this resistance,
            when the Arabs captured Rhages, they ordered the town to be
            destroyed and rebuilt anew by traitor aristocrat Farrukhzad.In the
            9th century, Tehran was a well-known village, but less known than
            the city of Rhages, which was flourishing nearby. Rhages was
            described in detail by 10th-century Muslim geographers.Despite the
            interest that Arabian Baghdad displayed in Rhages, the number of
            Arabs in the city remained insignificant and the population mainly
            consisted of Iranians of all classes.The Oghuz Turks invaded Rhages
            discretely in 1035 and 1042, but the city was recovered under the
            reigns of the Seljuks and the Khwarezmians.Medieval writer Najm od
            Din Razi declared the population of Rhages about 500,000 before the
            Mongol invasion. In the 13th century, the Mongols invaded Rhages,
            laid the city in ruins, and massacred many of its
            inhabitants.Following the invasion, many of the city's inhabitants
            escaped to Tehran. In July 1404, Castilian ambassador Ruy Gonz√°lez
            de Clavijo visited Tehran while on a journey to Samarkand, the
            capital of Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur, who ruled Iran at the time.
            In his diary, Tehran was described as an unwalled region.

          <h3>Early modern era</h3>
          <p class="blocktext">
            Italian traveler Pietro della Valle passed through Tehran overnight
            in 1618, and in his memoirs, he mentioned the city as Taheran.
            English traveler Thomas Herbert entered Tehran in 1627, and
            mentioned it as Tyroan. Herbert stated that the city had about 3,000
            houses.A portrait of Qajar ruler Agha Mohammad Khan, kept at
            London's V&A Museum In the early 18th century, Karim Khan of the
            Zand dynasty ordered a palace and a government office to be built in
            Tehran, possibly to declare the city his capital; but he later moved
            his government to Shiraz. Eventually, Qajar king Agha Mohammad Khan
            chose Tehran as the capital of Iran in 1786.Agha Mohammad Khan's
            choice of his capital was based on a similar concern for the control
            of both northern and southern Iran.He was aware of the loyalties of
            the inhabitants of former capitals Isfahan and Shiraz to the Safavid
            and Zand dynasties respectively, and was wary of the power of the
            local notables in these cities.Thus, he probably viewed Tehran's
            lack of a substantial urban structure as a blessing, because it
            minimized the chances of resistance to his rule by the notables and
            by the general public.Moreover, he had to remain within close reach
            of Azerbaijan and Iran's integral northern and southern Caucasian
            territories[24]‚Äîat that time not yet irrevocably lost per the
            treaties of Golestan and Turkmenchay to the neighboring Russian
            Empire‚Äîwhich would follow in the course of the 19th century.Map of
            Tehran in 1857 After 50 years of Qajar rule, the city still barely
            had more than 80,000 inhabitants.Up until the 1870s, Tehran
            consisted of a walled citadel, a roofed bazaar, and the three main
            neighbourhoods of Udlajan, Chale-Meydan, and Sangelaj, where the
            majority resided. The first development plan of Tehran in 1855
            emphasized the traditional spatial structure. Architecture, however,
            found an eclectic expression to reflect the new lifestyle. The
            second major planning exercise in Tehran took place under the
            supervision of Dar ol Fonun. The 1878 plan of Tehran included new
            city walls, in the form of a perfect octagon with an area of 19
            square kilometres, which mimicked the Renaissance cities of Europe.

          <h3>
            Late modern era
          </h3>
          <p class="blocktext">
            The growing social awareness of civil rights resulted in the
            Constitutional Revolution and the first constitution of Iran in
            1906. On June 2, 1907, the parliament passed a law on local
            governance known as the Baladie (municipal law), providing a
            detailed outline on issues such as the role of councils within the
            city, the members' qualifications, the election process, and the
            requirements to be entitled to vote. The then Qajar monarch Mohammad
            Ali Shah abolished the constitution and bombarded the parliament
            with the help of the Russian-controlled Cossack Brigade on June 23,
            1908. That followed the capture of the city by the revolutionary
            forces of Ali-Qoli Khan (Sardar Asad II) and Mohammad Vali Khan
            (Sepahsalar e Tonekaboni) on July 13, 1909. As a result, the monarch
            was exiled and replaced with his son Ahmad, and the parliament was
            re-established. Aerial view of Tehran in 1925 After World War I, the
            constituent assembly elected Reza Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty as the
            new monarch, who immediately suspended the Baladie law of 1907,
            replacing the decentralized and autonomous city councils with
            centralist approaches of governance and planning.[26] From the 1920s
            to the 1930s, under the rule of Reza Shah, the city was essentially
            rebuilt from scratch. That followed a systematic demolition of
            several old buildings, including parts of the Golestan Palace, Tekye
            Dowlat, and Tupkhane Square, which were replaced with modern
            buildings influenced by classical Iranian architecture, particularly
            the building of the National Bank, the Police Headquarters, the
            Telegraph Office, and the Military Academy. The changes in urban
            fabric started with the street-widening act of 1933, which served as
            a framework for changes in all other cities. The Grand Bazaar was
            divided in half and many historic buildings were demolished to be
            replaced with wide straight avenues.As a result, the traditional
            texture of the city was replaced with intersecting cruciform streets
            that created large roundabouts, located on major public spaces such
            as the bazaar. As an attempt to create a network for easy
            transportation within the city, the old citadel and city walls were
            demolished in 1937, replaced by wide streets cutting through the
            urban fabric. The new city map of Tehran in 1937 was heavily
            influenced by modernist planning patterns of zoning and gridiron
            networks.[26] During World War II, Soviet and British troops entered
            the city. In 1943, Tehran was the site of the Tehran Conference,
            attended by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Soviet Premier
            Joseph Stalin, and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

            The establishment of the planning organization of Iran in 1948
            resulted in the first socio-economic development plan to cover from
            1949 to 1955. These plans not only failed to slow the unbalanced
            growth of Tehran, but with the 1962 land reforms that Reza Shah's
            son and successor Mohammad Reza Shah named the White Revolution,
            Tehran's chaotic growth was further accentuated. Throughout the
            1960s and 1970s, Tehran was rapidly developing under the reign of
            Mohammad Reza Shah. Modern buildings altered the face of Tehran and
            ambitious projects were envisioned for the following decades. In
            order to resolve the problem of social exclusion, the first
            comprehensive plan of Tehran was approved in 1968. The consortium of
            Iranian architect Abd-ol-Aziz Farmanfarmaian and the American firm
            of Victor Gruen Associates identified the main problems blighting
            the city to be high-density suburbs, air and water pollution,
            inefficient infrastructure, unemployment, and rural-urban migration.
            Eventually, the whole plan was marginalized by the 1979 Revolution
            and the subsequent Iran‚ÄìIraq War.The Azadi Tower was built in 1971.
            Tehran's most famous landmark, the Azadi Tower, was built by the
            order of the Shah in 1971. It was designed by Hossein Amanat, an
            architect who won a competition to design the monument, combining
            elements of classical Sassanian architecture with post-classical
            Iranian architecture. Formerly known as the Shahyad Tower, it was
            built in commemoration of the 2,500th year of the foundation of the
            Imperial State of Iran. During the 1980‚Äì1988 Iran‚ÄìIraq War, Tehran
            was the target of repeated Scud missile attacks and airstrikes. The
            435-meter-high Milad Tower, which was part of the proposed
            development projects in pre-revolutionary Iran,[28] was completed in
            2007, and has thence become a famous landmark of Tehran. The
            270-meter pedestrian overpass of Tabiat Bridge is a newly built
            landmark,designed by award winning architect Leila Araghian, which
            was completed in 2014.
